# hashmax-free
This program demonstrates how to calculate the SHA256 hash of a password in C# using the System.Security.Cryptography library.


#*Password Hashing Script*
This repository contains a simple Python script and its equivalent C# version for hashing passwords using SHA-256 algorithm with a salt value. The script is provided for educational purposes and can be used as a starting point for building more secure password handling systems.

*Usage*
To use the Python script, simply run the password_hashing.py file in a Python environment and follow the prompts to input the password you want to hash. The resulting hashed password will be outputted to the console.

To use the C# version, compile and run the PasswordHashing.cs file in a C# development environment. The hashed password will be outputted to the console.
